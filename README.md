# QuizUp Android Client

## The Client
The `QuizUp client` is an implementation of Android client game, based on [Google's Griddler](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/solutions-griddler-sample-android-client)
which is a sample Android client for appengine demo.

## Notes
<ul>
<li>This is my high school project.</li>
<li>We have rewritten the middleware layer to work against the [QuizUp server](https://github.com/gnitzan/quizup-server) which is now a Spring Boot server with REST API.</li>
<li>We have also removed all Google+ related code and changed the authentication methods to work with google play services sign in.</li>
<li>The project was developed for my final high school project!</li>
</ul>
